1. Write	(and test!) a class method that will ask the operator for a real
number; print	an error message if the operator’s	input cannot be
converted to type double.

2. Write a program that expects	a comma-delimited string	of values	to
be passed from the	command line; parse the string	and print each
value.	Make	sure	you	handle	the	edge	cases	(null	string,	empty	
string,	etc.).

3. Write	a program that
	1. writes	20 lines	of data	to a file.
	2. Opens the file for reading, and prints	the contents	line by line.

4. Write	a program that asks the operator (via stdin) for a list of
integers, then computes and prints	the average of the numbers.
Validate all input;	if there is an	invalid	token print	an error message
and ask for the list	again.

5. A)	Write	a program that repeatedly	prompts the operator for a line of
data,	then writes	the line to a file. End the loop when the operator
enters “end.”

5. B) Write	 a program to open the file and print	 the contents	 line by
line.
